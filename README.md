# deja-vu

This was a project that a friend and I had 2 hours to complete. The parameters were that we had to use angular and 
do something/anything with the theme "Deja-vu". We quickly decided to make a memory style card game. You know, 
"Where did I just see that card?" Anyway, It worked for the presentation but we never finished our stretch goals.
